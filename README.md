 ## Setup

 In order for MikeRXRTools to run, it requires the Python Engine and the Pillow Module for photo editing.

 MikeRXRTools will run on Windows 10 and 11 computers.

 1. First, download Python 3.0 from the offical python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

 MAKE SURE TO SPECIFICALLY DOWNLOAD "Windows installer (64-bit)" FOR VERSIONS 3.12.0 OR ABOVE OR PILLOW WILL NOT INSTALL!

 2. Next, download the MikeRXRTools "Source code (Zip)" from the releases tab on the right.

 3. Once downloaded, extract the folder.

 4. Check if Python installed correctly by running a script in the MikeRXRTools folder called "Empty Temporary Folder Junk"

 You should be able to easily run Python scripts by double left clicking. 

 This will remove some temporary "junk" .txt files from all folders (This exists so GitHub will allow me to upload empty folders)

 If you open the folders and the junk .txt files are removed, this means Python has installed correctly!

 If there was an error, reinstall Python. If that doesn't work, try contacting me on Discord (Username: "Hopen111").

 Once Python works correctly, run the "INSTALLPILLOW" script. There is an "UNINSTALLPILLOW" script if needed.

 If all goes well, it should download Pillow without any errors.

 Now, you are done!

 ## Making Crossing Pages

 Since we have already set up the program (Hopefully), now we can begin making crossing pages!

 First, you will need to get some crossing photos, supported file types are: PNG, JPG, JEPG, and possibly a few more (HEIC WILL NOT WORK).

 Next, you have to get the basic crossing info such as street and city name, DOT, milepost, associated railroads, and the date the photos were taken, which will all be explained below!

 ## Making Crossing Headers

For making headers, you need to download a Header.PSD file template from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1URC-K7prmxNuoZrVuk6MTQeQu3_K3gDW

Next, go to photopea.com: https://www.photopea.com

Make sure to crop the header size to fit the text.

Then make the header and export as PNG!

 ## Finding Crossing Street Name and City

 You can use Google Maps or any accurate mapping service to find the street and city name.
