 ## Making Crossing Headers

For making headers, you need to download a Header.PSD file template from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1URC-K7prmxNuoZrVuk6MTQeQu3_K3gDW

Next, go to photopea.com: https://www.photopea.com

Make sure to crop the header size to fit the text.

Then make the header and export as PNG!
